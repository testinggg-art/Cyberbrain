# Cyberbrain: Python debugging, **redefined**.

Repo: https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain

Cyberbrain is a Python debugging solution aiming to **free programmers**. It visualizes **program execution** and **how each variable changes**.

Never spend hours stepping through the program, let Cyberbrain tell you.

Cyberbrain keeps your workflow unchanged. You run a program (from vscode or command line, both work), call **"Initialize Cyberbrain"** from the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), and a new panel will be opened to visualize how your program executed.
